Source code for the article "A hybrid identification method for mathematical models for Zika virus"


This paper studies some deterministic mathematical models that seek to explain the
expansion of Zika virus, as a viral epidemic, using published data for Brazil. Three SIR
type models considering several aspects in the spread of the disease are considered with 3, 6
and 10 unknown parameters respectively. The parameter identification is carried through a
search algorithm based on a combination of a stochastic domain exploration and a heuristic
calculation of a descent diretion, in order to avoid stopping the algorithm at a loal optimum.
